* Best viewed through a Markdown renderer, which can be found as a Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl?hl=en).
* How to open Markdown files once you have the Markdown renderer enabled (on a POSIX/UNIX compliant terminal/client):
```
open markdown-file.md -a Google\ Chrome
```
* Still a work in progress––feel free to contribute as you see fit. Thanks!
