Languages (similarities and differences)

### Java
* **Type system:** Strong, Static
* **Paradigms supported:** Object-oriented, structured, imperative, generic, concurrent
* **Nuances:**
   * Compiled
   * General purpose
   * Cross-platform (WORA)
   * Class based objects
   * Compiler implementation: JIT
   * JVM ⊂ JRE ⊂ JDK
   * Not 100% object oriented (primitve data types not objects)
   * Compile time polymorphism: method overloading
   * Runtime polymorphism: inheritance/interface
   * Automatic memory management
   * Performance: Worse than C/C++
   * Syntax: Influenced by C++, generics

### C
* **Type system:** Weak, Static
* **Paradigms supported:** Imperative, structured
* **Nuances:**
   * Compiled
   * General purpose
   * Cross-platform
   * Preprocessor performs macro definition, source code file inclusion, and conditional compilation
   * Ad hoc runtime polymorphism: function & data pointers
   * Static, automatic, and dynamic memory management
   * Data types
    * Pointers
    * Arrays
   * Performance: Excellent above other programming languages
   * Syntax: Influenced by ALGOL 68, FORTRAN, Assembly
   * Uses: Systems programming, operating systems, embedded systems, website programming, compilers, libraries, interpreters

### Python
* **Type system:** Weak, Dynamic, Duck
* **Paradigms supported:** Functional, imperative, Object-oriented, reflective
* **Nuances:**
   * Interpreted
   * General purpose
   * Functions and classes are first-class objects
   * Extensible and modular
   * Whitespace indentation as delimiters
   * Automatic memory management
   * GIL does not allow for *true* multithreading
   * Uses: Scripting, scientific computing, AI, information security

### SQL
* **Type system:** Strong, Static
* **Paradigms supported:** Declarative, procedural
* **Nuances:**
   * 
   * Cross platform

### CSS

* Paradigms supported: 
* Nuances: 

### HTML
* Type system: 
* Paradigms supported: 
* Nuances: 

### JavaScript
* **Type system:** Dynamic, Duck
* **Paradigms supported:** Event-driven, functional, imperative, object-oriented
* **Nuances:**
   * Interpreted
   * Prototype based objects
   * Ran in JavaScript runtime environments (e.g. engines of web browsers)
    * Processes messages from a queue until the event loop has terminated
    * Program I/O performed using events and callbacks
   * Enabled both client-side (web browsers) and server-side (web servers)
   * Functions are first class objects
   * Functions = methods (this isn't necessarily the case in C)
   * Functions double as object constructors
   * Objects are associative arrays
   * Uses prototypes for inheritance
   * Supports function-based implementations of Role patterns
   * Supports anonymous and variadic functions
   * Performance: 

### Shell
* **Type system:**
* **Paradigms supported:**
* **Nuances:**
