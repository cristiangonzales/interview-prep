# Arrays and Strings (from Leetcode)
* C++ stores 2D arrays as 1D arrays
* Java stores 2D arrays as m arrays, each with n elements
* C++ supports overloading, Java does not support overloading (e.g. using `==` to compare strings)
* *Immutable* – can't change the content of the string
  * C++ => mutable
  * Java => immutable
* Mutable strings in Java
  * Character arrays
  * `StringBuilder` – O(n) time for concatentation
